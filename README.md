## <TEAMNAME>`s code for car-like robot autopilot task 


### TODO
 - [ ] Lane detection
 - [ ] "Camera matrix/model"
 - [ ] Navigation 
 - [ ] Crossroads 
 - [ ] Road sign detection 
 - [ ] Traffic lights detection 
 - [ ] Pedestrian detection 
 - [ ] Optical flow


### Callibrate camera ?, Get approximate camera matrix ?
Get camera matrix from known information without special actions for example: detect points on the ground with known coordinates.


### Lane detection


### Crossroads
While the vehicle is driving through crossroads the stopline/lane detection algorithm is used for precise coordination of maneuvers.
And optical flow algorithms is used for addition accuracy improvemnts in velocity control.


### Stopline/lane detection algorithm for crossroads 


### Optical flow
Optical flow is used when the vehicle is driving through crossroads.


### Signs/Traffic/Pedestrian detection
One Yolo for all? yes
Grab Yolo model from НТИ АТС 2020? yes
